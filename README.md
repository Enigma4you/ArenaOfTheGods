Hack and slash arena game



***NOTE***

this game was not entirely my creation, and was a collaboration amongst several school peers. Unfortunately we were silly enough not to add credits page to list everyone who worked on the project.

Also note that the source code and assets are all missing. In the confusion that was this project, the only thing I managed to obtain before we parted was the compiled last scene. This scene was missing several other changes that were made, and doesn't reflect everything that was created and implemented for the game. This compiled project was the result of the (messily) merging of several projects and ended up losing lots of progress we made overall.
